Dear Spring community,

I'm pleased to announce that Spring Web Services 2.0.2.RELEASE has
been released!

This is the third GA release in the 2.0 release cycle. Most importantly, it
resolves a potential security issue when using WS-Security in combination with
response payload validation.

It is recommended that all current 2.0.x users upgrade to 2.0.2.

Please see the changelog for more details.
