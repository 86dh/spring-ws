Dear Spring community,

I'm pleased to announce that Spring Web Services 2.0 Milestone 1 has been
released!

This is the first milestone release in the 2.0 release cycle. It does not
introduce any new features (yet), but does add the following:

- Usage of Spring's OXM
- Java 5 API (including generics, varargs, etc)

Please see the changelog for details.

Spring Web Services 2.0 is due in the second quarter of 2010.
