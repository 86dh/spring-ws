Dear Spring community,

I'm pleased to announce that Spring Web Services 2.0 Release Candidate 2 has
been released!

This is the second release candidate in the 2.0 release cycle. The most
important new feature in this release is the update of the Spring-WS XML
namespace, which now contains <sws:annotation-driven/> and <sws:interceptors/>
elements (similar to the Spring-MVC namespace), and <sws:static-wsdl/>
<sws:dynamic-wsdl/> for exporting your WSDLs. 
All of these features are described in the updated reference documentation, 
which you can find here:

http://static.springsource.org/spring-ws/sites/2.0/reference/html/

We consider this release (RC2) complete. If no major new issues are found, we 
will release 2.0.0-RELEASE in the first half of January 2011.

While we did make some changes, Spring-WS 2.0 should be a drop-in
replacement for 1.5. The one exception is the 2.0 version of the XSD namespace, 
where we removed <sws:marshalling-endpoints/> and <sws:xpath-endpoints/> in
favor of <sws:anotation-driven/>. To keep using the two latter elements,
please make sure to use the 1.5 version of the XSD, like so:

<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:sws="http://www.springframework.org/schema/web-services" xsi:schemaLocation="
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/web-services http://www.springframework.org/schema/web-services/web-services-1.5.xsd">
       
To upgrade to <sws:annotation-driven/>, use the 2.0 version of the XSD:

<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
       xmlns:sws="http://www.springframework.org/schema/web-services" xsi:schemaLocation="
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd
       http://www.springframework.org/schema/web-services http://www.springframework.org/schema/web-services/web-services-2.0.xsd">
     
Please file a JIRA issue if you find any other regressions in the 2.0 RC2
release.

Please see the changelog for more details.
