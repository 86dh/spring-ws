Dear Spring community,

I'm pleased to announce that Spring Web Services 2.0 Release Candidate 1 has
been released!

This is the first release candidate in the 2.0 release cycle. The most
important new feature in this release is the completion of our integration test
facilities with the inclusion of the server-side Web service testing framework.
The testing framework is documented here:

http://static.springsource.org/spring-ws/sites/2.0/reference/html/client.html#d0e3596
and 
http://static.springsource.org/spring-ws/sites/2.0/reference/html/server.html#d0e3126

Note that we did have to make some changes in the client-side testing code, as 
compared to 2.0-M1.  I suggest you try out the new testing module today! Please
leave feedback through JIRA or on the forums.

While we have documented the new testing module, there are still other new
features that need to be documented. These are scheduled for RC2, but RC1 is
'code complete'. Unless we (or you!) find any issues, of course.

We're also interested in any regression that come up when upgrading.  While we
did make some changes, Spring-WS 2.0 should be a drop-in replacement for 1.5.
Please file a JIRA issue if you find any.

Please see the changelog for more details.

Spring Web Services 2.0 is due in Q4 2010/Q1 2011.
