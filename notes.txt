Dear Spring community,

I'm pleased to announce that Spring Web Services 2.1.0.RELEASE has been released!

This is the first GA release in the 2.1 release cycle. It mainly
consists of necessary upgrades to third party dependencies. Specifically:

- WSS4J has been upgraded to 1.6.
- XmlSchema has been upgraded to 2.0
- Support for Apache HttpClient 4.0
- JDOM has been upgraded to 2.0

and various other minor library upgrades.

Some of the library upgrades contain changes that are not backwards compatible.
As such, you might be required to change your code and/or configuration as a
consequence. More specifically:

WSS4J:
- SpringDigestPasswordValidationCallbackHandler and
  SpringPlainTestPasswordValidationCallbackHandler have been merged into
  SpringSecurityPasswordValidationCallbackHandler, which works the same way as
  the SpringDigestPasswordValidationCallbackHandler (i.e. supply it with a
  UserDetailsService).
- The Wss4jSecurityInterceptor no longer has the securementCallbackHandler
  property, as it's no longer used by WS4J.

JDOM:
- JDOM 2.0 changed the package name from org.jdom.x to org.jdom2.x. Make sure
  to switch to this new package when using JDOM in combination with
  @RequestBody/@ResponseBody as well as the AbstractJDomPayloadEndpoint.

<sws:annotation-driven/>
- When using <sws-annotation-driven/>, it might be required to set "order"
  property values on custom exception resolvers. See
  https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SWS-772?focusedCommentId=79384#comment-79384
  for more details.

Please see the changelog for more details.
